# PointVS_SERA_analsysis
A repo to store the analysis code for my second SABS rotation project.

The majority of code used to analyse model outputs and generate the figures in the report can be found in 'analysis.ipynb'.

This code can be run on the model outputs in 'model_outputs/'. Two models are contained in this dir; outputs from the basic PointVS model using MSE loss, and outputs from PointVS using SERA loss with control points 1_0_1.
